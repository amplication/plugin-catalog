description: Adds a Github Actions workflow file for building and pushing a container image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry. In addition, it creates a task definition for deploying the previously built image onto an Amazon Elastic Container Service cluster. It requires infrastructure to deploy onto to be present - how to create this infrastructure can be found on GitHub/NPM in the README section.
